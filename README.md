# Shop.net
Shop api in order to practice c#
It's not finished yet.
Fixes for now:
* you can't get two the same products(id) in order. It's need to be fixed
* extend imports validation and consider optimalization

To implement:
* logger
* user auth(in progress)
* TODO endpoints: findAllUserOrders(), findProductsByCatergories()
* Print invoice, finish PDF, create word + download from api (both)
